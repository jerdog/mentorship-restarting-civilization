# Mentorship, or How to rebuild civilisation from scratch
***How really important are mentorship and documentation to the survival of civilization? What would happen if we lost everything and had to start over, say, due to a global pandemic? In this talk, weâ€™ll explore my fascination with dystopian TV shows and seek to answer these questions, and come to some action steps to do our part through mentorship, documentation, and more.***

### Running locally
_Instructions taken from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)_

1. Identify which version of Python is installed
```bash
python -V
# If the above fails, try:
python3 -V
# Or, if the "py" command is available, try:
py -V
```

2. Enter directory for this repo and type one of the following:
```bash
# If Python version returned above is 3.X
# On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"
python3 -m http.server
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

3. This will set the contents of the folder as a local web server on port `8000`. You can visit that via http://localhost:8000, where it will even auto load the `index.html` file or show you the contents to choose what to display.
